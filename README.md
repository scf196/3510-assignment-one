First assignment for PHYS 3510, due Friday, August 29th at 5:00 PM
## Question One
### "How do you expect the rigid pendulum will respond if the frequency of the drive is much higher or much lower than the natural frequency ($\omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}$) of the pendulum (for small oscillations) and the amplitude is small compared to the size of the pendulum?"

## Question Two
### "If the pendulum is slightly displaced from equilibrium and the pivot point moves down abruptly, what will happen to the pendulum's displacement angle?"
The displacement angle should get larger in the same direction the pendulum was displaced in, similar to how if someone with long hair falls straight down, their hair will "fly up." If the pendulum is particularly dense, it may resist this change.
## Question Three
### "If we start the pendulum oriented above its pivot point, at its unstable equilibrium angle, if the pivot point moves down as the pendulum begins to fall, what is your expectation of the behavior?"
Intuitively, it's hard to think about what would happen if the pivot point moved as the pendulum falls down. Initially I thought that it'd just make the movement more "chaotic" and "random," and it'd be impossible to predict,
